ECM Developer is an Eclipse plug-in aimed at supporting the development of applications using the IBM FileNet P8 Content Engine or CMIS compliant repositories.

The basic features are browsing, creating, comparing and modifying objects. Searches can be designed using a graphical query editor fully integrated in the Eclipse IDE. Documents can be tracked within the Eclipse IDE enabling fast updates of the content.

More advanced features are building UML diagrams based on the class definitions, running Java code using object store objects as input and editing Content Engine Code Modules.
