	<h2>Browsing Object Stores</h2>
	<p>
	There are two views that can be used for browsing the object stores: the <strong>Object Stores</strong>
	view or the <strong>Object Store Favorites</strong> view. Most of the actions described here are available 
	for both views. Changes made in one view will also be visible in the other view. 
	</p>
	<p>
	You can open both views by switching to the <strong>Content Engine</strong> perspective or by using the 
	<strong>Window &gt; Show view &gt;Other</strong> command. Both views are located in the 
	<strong>Content Engine</strong> category. Selecting	the Object Stores view will show the following window:
	<p><img alt='object stores view' src='images/browsing_object_stores/object_stores_view.jpg'/></p>
	If this window is empty you have to setup your connections to the Content Engine. See the 
	<a href='getting_started.shtml'>getting started</a> page for details.
	</p>
	<p>
	First you have to make a connection to the Object Store using either the context menu of
	the Object Store or the toolbar button (<img width='16' height='16' alt='Connect' src='images/icons/database_connect.png'/>) 
	of the view. Double clicking will also connect the Object Store. When the Object Store is connected the
	Object Store can be browsed, showing folders, documents and custom objects. Also additional
	Object Stores can be added to this view using the toolbar button 
	(<img width='16' height='16' alt='Import' src='images/icons/database_add.png'/>). In this view you can
	perform the operations possible on Object Store items.
	</p>
	
	<a name='new'><h3>New</h3></a>
	<p>
	One of the ways new Folders, documents and Custom Objects can be created is using the <strong>New</strong> command of the 
	context menu when an Object Store or a Folder is selected. This command will open the 
	<a href='creating_objects.shtml'>new objects</a> wizard.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Checkout, Cancel Checkout, Save and Checkin</h3></a>
	<p>
	See the <a href='editing_content.shtml'>editing content</a> page for more details.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Edit</h3>
	<p>
	The properties of an Object Store item can be edited using the <strong>Edit</strong> command of the 
	context menu. This command will open the <a href='editing_objects.shtml'>properties editor</a> window.
	<p>

	<h3>Edit document version</h3>
	<p>
	The properties of a specific version of a document can be edited using the <strong>Edit document version</strong> command of the 
	context menu. This command will first prompt for a version and next opens the <a href='editing_objects.shtml'>properties editor</a> window.
	<p>
	
	<h3>Refresh</h3>
	<p>
	An Object Store item can be refreshed using either the <strong>File &gt; Refresh</strong> command
	or the <strong>Refresh</strong> command of the context menu. This command will get a fresh copy
	of the item on the server.
	</p>
	
	<a name='add_favorite'><h3>Add to Favorites</h3></a>
	<p>
	An Object Store item can be added to Content Engine Favorites view using the <strong>Add to Favorites</strong> 
	command of the context menu. The item is now also visible in the Object Store Favorites view
	directly under the Object Store the item belongs to. The <strong>Remove from Favorites</strong> 
	command of the context menu can be used to remove the item from the Object Store Favorites view.
	</p>
	<a name='rename'><h3>Rename</h3></a>
	<p>
	An Object Store item can be renamed using either the <strong>File &gt; Rename</strong> command
	or the <strong>Rename</strong> command of the context menu. A dialog will appear where a new name
	for the item can be entered:
	<p><img alt='Rename' src='images/browsing_object_stores/rename.jpg'/></p>
	A check is made if the entered name is correct.
	</p>
	
	<a name='move'><h3>Move</h3></a>
	<p>
	An Object Store item can be moved using either the <strong>File &gt; Move</strong> command
	or the <strong>Move</strong> command of the context menu. A dialog will appear where a new 
	folder location for the item can be selected:
	<p><img alt='Move' src='images/browsing_object_stores/move.jpg'/></p>
	In case of a multiple selection the new location will apply for all the items selected.
	</p>
	 	
	<a name='delete'><h3>Delete</h3></a>
	<p>
	Object Store items can be deleted using either the <strong>Edit &gt; Delete</strong> command
	or the <strong>Delete</strong> command of the context menu. This command will open the 
	<a href='deleting_objects.shtml'>delete</a> wizard. 
	</p>
	
	<a name='delete_versions'><h3>Delete Versions</h3></a>
	<p>
	An Document Version can be deleted using the <strong>Delete Versions</strong> command 
	of the context menu. First a dialog is shown, displaying all the versions of the document. All the
	versions selected in this dialog will be deleted.
	</p>

	<a name='view'><h3>View</h3></a>
	<p>
	Documents can be viewed using the <strong>View</strong> command of the context menu. This menu contains
	three sub items:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Released Version</strong>: this will show the released version of the document. If the latest
	major version is zero the current version is shown. Otherwise the version with a zero minor version and the highest major
	version is shown. If a document is double clicked then also the released version is shown.</li>
	<li><strong>Current Version</strong>: this will show the version with the highest major and minor version.</li>   
	<li><strong>View Document Version</strong>: this will show specific versions of a document. First a dialog is shown, 
	displaying all the versions of the document. All the versions selected in this dialog will be shown.
	</ul>
	<p>
	When viewing starts, first a read only local copy of the content of the document is made. Next the file 
	is opened, either in the  available Eclipse editor or in an external system editor. If the document has no 
	content then a message is shown. If the document contains multiple content elements then specific content elements 
	of the document can be selected. If possible the local copy will be deleted when the editor closes. 
	If this is not possible for the specific editor then the file will be deleted when Eclipse terminates 
	or restarts.
	</p>
	   
	<a name='download'><h3>Download</h3></a>
	<p>
	The content of documents can be downloaded using the <strong>Download</strong> command of the context menu. 
	This menu contains the same	three sub items as the <strong>View</strong> command, but instead of opening a 
	viewer the content can be downloaded into the current Eclipse workspace. The user is prompted for a filename
	and a location in the workspace. If a existing document in the workspace
	is about to be overwritten then a confirmation is asked.
	</p>

	<a name='compare'><h3>Compare</h3></a>
	<p>
	Documents can be compared using the <strong>Compare</strong> command of the context menu. This menu contains
	four sub items:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Released Version With Local File</strong>: this will compare the released version of the document 
	with a local file in the Eclipse workspace.</li>
	<li><strong>Other Versions With Local File</strong>: this will compare other versions of the document with a local
	file in the Eclipse workspace. First a dialog is shown, 
	displaying all the versions of the document. All the versions selected in this dialog will be 
	compared with a local file.</li>
	<li><strong>Versions With Each Other</strong>: this will compare two version of the same document with each other.
	First a dialog is shown, displaying all the versions of the document. If there are not two versions selected then
	an error message will be displayed.</li>
	<li><strong>Released Versions With Each Other</strong>: this will compare the released versions of two documents
	with each other. If there are not two documents selected then an error message will be displayed.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The contents of the documents are compared using the standard text compare engine of Eclipse.</p>
