	<h2>Creating Objects</h2>
	<p>
	One of the features of the ECM Developer plug in is creating new Folders, Documents and Custom Objects. There
	are different ways the object creation wizard can be started:
	<ul>
	<li>With the <strong>New</strong> command of the context menu when an Object Store or a Folder is selected in 
	the Object Stores view or the Object Store Favorites View.</li>
	<li>With the standard Eclipse New wizard by using the <strong>File &gt; New &gt; Other</strong> command, and  
	after that selecting the desired item in the <strong>Content Engine</strong> category.
	</li>
	<li>If the <strong>Content Engine</strong> perspective is selected then there is a shortcut to the different
	items under the <strong>File &gt; New</strong> menu.
	<li>For documents there is an extra option. A specific file in the Workspace can be added using the 
	<strong>Content Engine &gt; Add to Object Store</strong> command of the context menu of the file. In this case the
	name of the file is the default document title.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	On the first page of the creation wizard the parent must be selected. If the wizard was started from the context
	menu of a Object Store or a Folder then this wizard page is already pre-populated with the selection:
	</p>
	<p><img alt='Select Parent' src='images/creating_objects/select_parent.png'/></p>
	<p>
	It is possible to select an Object Store as parent when a Document or Custom Object is created. In that case the
	resulting object will be created unfiled. If the wizard is finished at this point the default class will be used 
	for the object to be created.
	</p>
	<p>
	On the second page of the wizard the class of the new object can be selected:
	</p>
	<p><img alt='Select Class' src='images/creating_objects/select_class.png'/></p>
	<p>
	For Folders and Custom Objects this is the last wizard page. For Documents there are two more pages left. If the
	wizard is finished at this time a major version Document with no content will be created. 
	</p>
	<p>
	On the next page the content of the document can be set. If the wizard was started from the content menu of a file
	in the Workspace then the this wizard page is already pre-populated with the selected file:
	</p>
	<p><img alt='Select Document Content' src='images/creating_objects/select_document_content.png'/></p>
	<p>
	On the final wizard page some additional details can be specified:
	</p>
	<p><img alt='Configure Create Document' src='images/creating_objects/configure_create_document.png'/></p>
	<p>
	When the creation wizard is finished the <a href='editing_objects.shtml'>properties editor</a> is opened. In this
	editor the properties of the new object can be edited and the required properties can be given a value. If this 
	editor is saved then the new object will be created.
	</p>
