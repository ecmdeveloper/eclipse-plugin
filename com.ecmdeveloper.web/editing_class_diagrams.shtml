	<h2>Editing Class Diagrams</h2>
	<p>
	The ECM Developer plug contains an editor that can be used to create a UML class diagram of the document, folder
	and custom object classes defined in the Object Store. The diagrams can be printed or exported to
	an image file.
	
	<h3>Content Engine Class Diagram Perspective</h3>
	
	<p>For convenient editing of the Class Diagrams the Content Engine Class Diagram perspective must be opened first. 
	With the <strong>Window &gt; Open Perspective &gt; Other</strong> command the perspective selection window is opened. 
	In this window the <strong>Content Engine Class Diagram</strong> perspective can be selected. This perspective contains on the left 
	side the Object Store Classes View. In this view for each defined connection and Object Store the classes can be 
	browsed. Browsing can only be done is the Object Store is already connected. If the Object Store is not connected 
	using one of the other views of the plug in then in the content menu of the Object Store a connection can be made 
	to the Content Engine.
	</p>
	<h3>Creating Class Diagrams</h3>
	<p>
	The following actions have to be performed to accomplish this task:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Start the standard Eclipse New wizard by using the <strong>File &gt; New &gt; Other</strong> command:
	<p><img src='images/editing_class_diagram/new_class_diagram.png' alt='New Class Diagram'/></p>
	Select the Content Engine Class Diagram in the Content Engine category.
	</li>
	
	<li>In the next page of the wizard the necessary information can be supplied to start editing the new Class Diagram.		
	</li>
	
	<li>If the wizard is finished a new file with the extension classdiagram is created and the the Class Diagram editor is 
	opened for this file.</li>
	
	<h3>Editing the Class Diagram</h3>
	<p>
	To edit the Class Diagram the Object Store Classes view must be opened and connected  to the Object Store. 
	Use either drag-and-drop or the context menu of the class to add the class to the Class Diagram. A UML figure 
	will be drawn of the class and all the attributes it contains:
	</p>
	<img src='images/editing_class_diagram/single_class.jpeg' alt='Single Class' border='1'>
	<p>
	If a parent class or a child class is added to the diagram then they are connected to each other 
	using an inherit relationship. The attributes of the child class defined in the parent class are now 
	moved to the parent class:
	</p>
	<img src='images/editing_class_diagram/class_with_parent.jpeg' alt='Class with parent' border='1'>
	<p>
	If a class is added to the diagram describing an object value property of another class then the classes 
	are also connected using a association relationships. If there is also a reflective property defined 
	then the arrows are shown on both editpoints, otherwise only one arrow is shown:
	</p>
	<img src='images/editing_class_diagram/class_with_association.jpeg' alt='Class with association' border='1'>
	<p>
	If the relation between the two classes is marked as “cascade on delete” then a much stronger relation 
	is assumed. In this case the classes are connected using an aggregation relation:
	</p>
	<img src='images/editing_class_diagram/class_with_aggregation.jpeg' alt='Class with aggregation' border='1'>
