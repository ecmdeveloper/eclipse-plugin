	<h2>Introduction</h2>
 	<p>
	ECM Developer is an Eclipse Plugin aimed at supporting the development of applications using FileNet P8 system. 
	It approaches the system from a developers point of view and tries to find solutions for day to day tasks. 
	An example is the development of event actions with related code modules. Part of developing event actions 
	involve updating an existing code module and reconnecting the new version of the code module 
	with the event action. Altough this process can be streamlined using a custom java application 
	doing all these actions, a generic solutions is preferable. This is what the ECM Developer plugin 
	offers.
 	</p>
 	<p>
	The aim of the ECM Developer plugin is not to be a replacement for the FileNet Enterprise Manager 
	but to focus on things you cannot do with the Enterprise Manager. However this does not mean that 
	there is no overlap in functionality between the ECM Developer plugin and the Enterprise Manager. 
	To come to a streamlined application it is inevitable that some of the functionality of the 
	Enterprise Manager is duplicated.
 	</p>
 	
	<p>Features at this moment includes:</p>
	<ul>
			<li>Browsing Object Stores</li>
			<li>Performing some basic actions on Object Store objects such as renaming, moving and deleting.</li>
			<li>Java code wizards for event action handlers, document lifecycle handlers and document classifiers.</li>
			<li>An editor for updating code modules.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	The plugin uses the Java API based on the WSI protocol to access the FileNet P8 system. 
	This is the most generic way of accessing the system and does not depend on the underlying 
	system architecture. Because the Java API is not distributed with this plugin, using this plugin 
	requires access to the Java API. Information about installing the plugin can be found here. 
	After the plugin is installed the Object Stores managed with this plugin must be imported. 
	Information about importing an Object Store can be found here.

	The ECM Developer is open source software and is distributed under the GNU Lesser General 
	Public License.
