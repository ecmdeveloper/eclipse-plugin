	<h2>Installing ECM Developer</h2>
	
	The ECM Developer plugin uses Java 6, so first make sure that your Eclipse is running
	with this version. The plugin is tested with the recent versions of Helios, Galileo and Ganymede.
	<p> 
	The plugin uses the Java API based on the WSI protocol to access the FileNet P8 system. 
	Because the Java API is not distributed with this plugin, using this plug-in requires 
	access to the Java API. Therefore installing this plugin is a little bit more complicated
	than a basic plugin install.
	<p>Before you install this plugin you have to make sure that you have the Content Engine Client 
	files available on your local machine. There a two ways to obtain these files:
	<ul>
	<li>
	The Content Engine Client files are located in a folder named <b>CE_API</b> in the FileNet 
	installation folder on the Application Engine server. You can copy this folder to your 
	local machine.
	</li>
	<li>If you don't have access to this folder the Content Engine Client files can also be installed
	using the Content Engine Client installer. 
	</ul>
	<p>
	The ECM Developer plugin can be installed using the Eclipse update site <strong>http://www.ecmdeveloper.com/update</strong>	or 
	downloaded from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ecmdeveloper/files/">project download site</a>. Refer 
	to documentation of your Eclipse version how to install plugins. Make sure that you select the correct version of
	the plugin depending on the version of the FileNet Content Engine you are using. You can only select <strong>one</strong> version,
	both versions within the same Eclipse instance will not work!
	</p>   
	<p>
	After the plug-in is installed do <strong>not</strong> restart Eclipse immediately. For the plug-in to work
	properly first the Content Engine Client files must be made available within the Eclipse 
	environment. First navigate to the <strong>plugins</strong> folder of your eclipse installation. The
	installation of the ECM Developer plug-in created a folder called <strong>com.ecmdeveloper.plugin.lib_1.2.0</strong> (for Content Engine 4.5.1 and beyond) or
	<strong>com.ecmdeveloper.plugin.lib_1.1.0</strong> (For Content Engine 4.5).
	This folder already contains some files. Now the <i>content</i> of the <strong>CE_API</strong> folder must
	copied to this folder. After this the installation is completed and Eclipse must be restarted.
