	<h2>Installing ECM Developer</h2>
	
	The plug-in uses the Java API based on the WSI protocol to access the FileNet P8 system. 
	Because the Java API is not distributed with this plug-in, using this plug-in requires 
	access to the Java API. Therefore installing this plug-in is a little bit more complicated
	than a basic plug-in install.
	<p>Before you install this plug-in you have to make sure that you
	have the Content Engine Client files available on your local machine. There a two ways to 
	obtain these files:
	<ul>
	<li>
	The Content Engine Client files are located in a folder named <b>CE_API</b> in the FileNet 
	installation folder on the Application Engine server. You can copy this folder to your 
	local machine.
	</li>
	<li>If you don't have access to this folder the Content Engine Client files can also be installed
	using the Content Engine Client installer. 
	</ul>
	The ECM Developer plug-in can be installed from the update site at <b>http://www.ecmdeveloper.com/update</b>. 
	(The update site can be configured in the dialog that appears if you select the 
	<b>Help &gt; Software Updates... &gt; Add Site</b> commands in the Eclipse IDE):  
	<p>
	<img alt='add site dialog'/>
	<p>
	If this does not work (if for example you are behind a firewall) then you could install
	the plug-in from the <a href='http://www.ecmdeveloper.com/todo'>zip-file distibution</a>. In this
	case use the <b>Archive</b> command in the Add Site dialog.
	<p>
	After the plug-in is installed do not restart Eclipse inmediately. For the plug-in to work
	properly first the Content Engine Client files must be made available within the Eclipse 
	environment. First navigate to the <b>plugins</b> folder of your eclipse installation. The
	installation of the ECM Developer plug-in created a folder called <b>com.ecmdeveloper.plugin.lib_1.0.0</b>.
	This folder already contains some files. Now the <i>content</i> of the <b>CE_API</b> folder must
	copied to this folder. After this the installation is completed and Eclipse must be restarted.
