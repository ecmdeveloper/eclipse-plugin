	<h2>Installing ECM Developer</h2>
	
	The ECM Developer plug-in uses Java 6, so first make sure that your Eclipse is running
	with this version. The plug-in is tested with the recent versions of Galileo and Ganymede.
	<p> 
	The plug-in uses the Java API based on the WSI protocol to access the FileNet P8 system. 
	Because the Java API is not distributed with this plug-in, using this plug-in requires 
	access to the Java API. Therefore installing this plug-in is a little bit more complicated
	than a basic plug-in install.
	<p>Before you install this plug-in you have to make sure that you
	have the Content Engine Client files available on your local machine. There a two ways to 
	obtain these files:
	<ul>
	<li>
	The Content Engine Client files are located in a folder named <b>CE_API</b> in the FileNet 
	installation folder on the Application Engine server. You can copy this folder to your 
	local machine.
	</li>
	<li>If you don't have access to this folder the Content Engine Client files can also be installed
	using the Content Engine Client installer. 
	</ul>
	The ECM Developer plug-in can be downloaded from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ecmdeveloper/files/">project download site</a>. 
	The plug-in can be installed into your Eclipse environment in the dialog that appears if 
	you select the <strong>Help &gt; Install new software... &gt; Add</strong> commands (Galileo) or 
	<strong>Help &gt; Software Updates... &gt; Add Site</strong> commands (Ganymede) in the Eclipse IDE:
	<p>
	<img src='images/installing/add_site.jpg' alt='add site dialog'/>
	</p>
	In this dialog use the <strong>Archive</strong> command and select the downloaded file. After this dialog
	is completed the ECM Developer plug-in should appear in the list of available software and can 
	be installed using the <strong>Install</strong> command.
	<p>
	After the plug-in is installed do not restart Eclipse inmediately. For the plug-in to work
	properly first the Content Engine Client files must be made available within the Eclipse 
	environment. First navigate to the <strong>plugins</strong> folder of your eclipse installation. The
	installation of the ECM Developer plug-in created a folder called <strong>com.ecmdeveloper.plugin.lib_1.1.0</strong>.
	This folder already contains some files. Now the <i>content</i> of the <strong>CE_API</strong> folder must
	copied to this folder. After this the installation is completed and Eclipse must be restarted.
